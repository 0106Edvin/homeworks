	<h3>1899 -1909 Foundation and Survival</h3>
	<p>
		FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona, was the result of the increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe. These origins have conferred upon the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted allegiance to Barcelona and Catalonia.
		The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when people were becoming interested in playing sport in Catalonia; this social context and Cataloniaâ€™s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation of a new model of modern leisure.
		Joan Gamper, the Clubâ€™s founder, was the inspiration and driving force behind the Clubâ€™s first 25 years. His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond his role as player, director and president.

		<h3>1909-1919 Consolidation at the Carrer de la IndÃºstria Football Ground</h3>
		<p>
			In November 1908, the Club was struggling, with 38 of its members about to abandon it. Gamper was determined to keep the Club afloat and for the first time he became president of the organisation.

			This marked a new stage in the Club's history, which consolidated it within the football panorama and social milieu of the city and country. A number of different circumstances played a part in this process, including its strengthening as an organisation via the steady growth of its members; the re-writing of the Club statutes, and the acquisition of the Club's own football grounds for the first time. At the same time, a range of sporting successes and growing recognition accorded to players saw football develop into a mass phenomenon, turning it into a professional sport.

			The Club grew rapidly. The number of members increased from 201 in 1909 to 2,973 in less than ten years.

			During these years, BarÃ§a laid down solid foundations in order to define the type of football club it wanted to be. This took it beyond the original dream of the group of friends that had founded it in 1899; the Club was here to stay.

		<h3>1919. Ricardo Zamora, Legendary Goalkeeper</h3>
		<p>
			Hedebuted alongside Samitier and, together, these players marked a turning point inthe Club's sporting history.

			Zamora, nicknamed "el DivÃ­" (The Divine One), only played with BarÃ§a for threeseasons, but his performances meant he left his mark on the team.

		<h3>1930-1939 Struggling against History</h3>
		<p>
			FC Barcelona was committed to social, political and cultural reform, initiated by the Republican Catalan government. The official Club newsletter in October 1932 made the Clubâ€™s position clear: â€œOur clubâ€™s popularity undeniably includes elements that are not related to sport.â€� Participation in political and cultural acts formed part of this commitment.
			The 1930s were marked by political instability and general crisis, which inevitably took its toll on FC Barcelona. During this decade, the Club endured many cataclysmic events, which included its founderâ€™s death, the Second Spanish Republic, the Spanish Civil War and the assassination of its president, Josep SuÃ±ol. In summary, it was a period characterised by uncertainty, which saw a reduction in membership and the cancellation of some playersâ€™ contracts.

		<h3>1940-1949 Years of Perseverance</h3>
		<p>
			The toughest moments experienced by FC Barcelona football club were the initial post-war years. The Club would not disappear without a fight. Subject to relentless repression and purges by the army and authorities, the identity of the organisation was changed completely.

			The team formation in subsequent years, however, led to more promising title victories in the 1950s.
			For many people, BarÃ§aâ€™s matches at Les Corts represented an oasis of freedom during years of fear, misery and repression.

		<h3>1957. The Inauguration of the Camp Nou</h3>
		<p>
			The grounds were inaugurated during the presidency of Francesc MirÃ³-Sans, on 24 September 1957, on the day of La MercÃ¨, Barcelonaâ€™s patron saint. BarÃ§a enjoyed its first victory in the stadium, 4-2. Eulogio MartÃ­nez scored the first goal.
			The stadium had an initial capacity of 93,053 spectators. The total cost of the Camp Nou was 288,088,143 pesetas. Today, Camp Nou is the stadium with the largest capacity in Europe, accommodating 98,772 spectators.
